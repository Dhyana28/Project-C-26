Step 1:
Cut the lemons lengthwise in half with a sharp knife. Most people cut across the width of a lemon. Instead of doing that, make a vertical cut down the center of each lemon. It makes the lemon halves easier to squeeze, allowing you to get a little more juice out of them. 

Step 2:
Squeeze the juice out into a bowl if you’re doing it by hand. Place the bowl on a countertop and juice the lemon halves into it one at a time. Most of the juice will flood out after a gentle squeeze. After the juice stops flowing, apply more pressure to wring out the remaining drops. Finish by poking the cut part of the lemon with a fork and twisting to remove any remaining juice.

Step 3:
Crush the lemon in a citrus press as an alternative. Position the lemon with the cut side down. Press the handles together to crush the juice out. If you have a round juicer, push the cut end of the lemon onto the plastic spike in the center. Spin the lemon back and forth while pushing down on it.

Step 4:
Put the lemon in an electric juicer if you don’t mind pulp. Electric juicers are similar to the spiked manual ones. Push the cut end of the lemon onto the spike in the center, then turn on the juicer. The spike rotates to make as much juice as possible. The only downside is that it also cuts up the pith you may not want in your juice.

Step 5:
Mix water or sugar into the juice if it tastes too sour. The juice is finished once you’re done squeezing, especially if you used big, juicy lemons that aren’t very acidic. Taste the juice to see if it’s the way you want it. If it seems too strong, mix in about 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of sugar for each lemon you used. You could also add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of water per lemon to dilute the juice.

Step 6:
Store the juice in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Pour the juice into a resealable container labeled with today’s date. It will turn bitter after that, so freeze it if you don’t plan on using it right away. The juice will retain its quality for up to 4 months after freezing it.
